0v3r jaaa!!!!!

## Whoooaaat you sayin?

Let's talk have fun with letters and numbers.

## Seriously?

Yeah.
Like... at least a bit.

### Preparation

1. _Fork_ the repository at https://github.com/zeropaper/x-gibberish and
then clone it on your machine.

2. Install `nodemon` with `npm` globally. For that, open a terminal and 
use `npm install -g nodemon`.

3. In your terminal, go to the directory of the x-gibberish exercise and
execute `nodemon` like `nodemon index.js`. Now, everytime you make a
change to `index.js`, the script will be executed.

### Exercise

Here's a fine piece of text:

`Un chasseur sachant chasser sans son chien est un bon chasseur`

Edit the body of the `gibberish(input)` function in the `index.js`
so it transforms the `input` argument into:

`Un ch4553ur 54ch4nt ch4553r 54n5 50n ch13n 35t un b0n ch4553ur`
